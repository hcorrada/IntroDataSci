# Brief Introduction to Rmarkdown

Rstudio has created an impressive eco-system for publishing
with R. It has concentrated around two systems: `Rmarkdown` for 
creating documents that include both text and data analysis code, publishable in multiple formats, and `shiny`, a framework for creating interactive html applications that allow users to explore
data analyses.

Rstudio has provided substantial tutorials and documentation
for Rmarkdown: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
  
The tutorial included in that website is quite good: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html. In class we will go over some of the key points using the same Rmarkdown file as an example:
