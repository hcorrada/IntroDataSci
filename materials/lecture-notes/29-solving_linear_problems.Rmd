# Solving linear ML problems

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

In this unit we address the question: How to fit the type of analysis methods we've seen so far?

We saw previously that learning methods based on group-by and summarize type of workflows, e.g., trees and LDA can be fit efficiently using a shared-nothing parallel architecture like Map-Reduce. This leaves other learning methods we have seen, like linear and logistic regression. In those cases, the key insight to answer this question is to recognize that these methods were presented as **optimization problems** and we can devise optimization algorithms that process  data efficiently.

We will use linear regression as a case study of how this insight would work.

## Case Study

Let's use linear regression with one predictor, no intercept as a case study.

**Given**: Training set $\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$, with continuous response $y_i$ and single predictor $x_i$ for the $i$-th observation.

**Do**: Estimate parameter $\beta_1$ in model $y=\beta_1 x$ to solve

$$
\min_{\beta_1} L(\beta_1) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_1 x_i)^2
$$

And suppose we want to fit this model to the following (simulated) data:

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=15}
set.seed(1234)
true_beta <- 5
x <- runif(100, -10, 10)
y <- x * true_beta + rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=sqrt(10))
plot(x,y,pch=19,cex=1.4,main="Simulated Data", cex.lab=1.5, cex.main=2)
abline(a=0, b=true_beta, col="red", lwd= 2)
```

Our goal is then to find the value of $\beta_1$ that minimizes mean squared error. This corresponds to finding one of these many possible lines:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=15}
plot(x,y,pch=19,cex=1.4,main="Simulated Data", cex.lab=1.5, cex.main=2)
abline(a=0, b=true_beta, col="red", lwd= 2)
for (b in seq(-6,6, len=5)) {
  abline(a=0,b=b,col="blue", lwd=2, lty=2)
}
legend("bottom", legend=paste("beta=", seq(-6,6,len=5)), lwd=2, lty=2, cex=1.5)
```

Each of which has a specific error for this dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=15}
n <- length(y)
compute_loss <- function(beta, x, y) {
  0.5 * mean((y-x*beta)^2)
}
beta <- seq(-20, 20, len=100)
plot(beta, sapply(beta, compute_loss, x=x, y=y), type="l", lwd=2, ylab=expression(L(beta[1])),cex.lab=1.5,xlab=expression(beta[1]))
abline(v=true_beta, col="red", lwd=2)
abline(v=seq(-6,6,len=5), col="blue", lwd=2, lty=2)
```

Insights:

1) As we saw before in class, loss is minimized when the derivative of the loss function is 0

2) and, the derivative of the loss (with respect to $\beta_1$ ) at a given estimate $\beta_1$ suggests new values of $\beta_1$ with smaller loss!

Let's take a look at the derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_{1}} L(\beta_1) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_{1}} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_1 x_i)^2 \\
{} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_1 x_i) \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_1} (y_i - \beta_1 x_i) \\
{} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_1 x_i) (-x_i)
$$


and plot it for our case study data:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=15, fig.height=10, cache=FALSE}
loss_derivative <- function(beta, x, y) {
  f <- beta * x
  resid <- y - f
  sum(resid * (-x))
}

plot(beta, sapply(beta, loss_derivative, x=x, y=y), type="l", lwd=1.5, xlab=expression(beta[1]), ylab=expression(partialdiff * L(beta[1]) / partialdiff * beta[1]),cex.lab=1.7)

abline(v=true_beta, col="red", lwd=2)
abline(v=seq(-6,6,len=5), col="blue", lwd=2, lty=2)
abline(h=0, col="black", lwd=2, lty=2)
```

## Gradient Descent

This plot suggests an algorithm:

1. Initialize $\beta_1=0$
2. Repeat until convergence
  - Set $\beta_1 = \beta_1 + \alpha \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i)) x_i$
  
This algorithm is called **gradient descent** in the general case.

The basic idea is to move the current estimate of $\beta_1$ in the direction that minimizes loss the *fastest*. Another way of calling this algorithm is **Steepest Descent**.

This is a full implementation of this algorithm in R:

```{r}
# Implementation of gradient descent for least squares regression
# for a single predictor (x)
#
# There is some code here that is only used to generate illustrative plots and would not be part of real solver
gradient_descent <- function(x, y, tol=1e-6, maxit=50, plot=FALSE) {
  # initialize estimate
  beta_1 <- 0; old_beta_1 <- Inf; i <- 0; beta_keep <- NA
  
  # compute loss at first estimate
  loss <- compute_loss(beta_1, x, y); loss_keep <- NA
  
  # starting step size
  alpha <- 1e-3
  difference <- Inf
  
  # check for convergence
  # (in practice, we do include a limit on the number of iterations)
  while ((difference > tol) && (i < maxit)) {
    cat("it: ", i, " beta: ", round(beta_1, 2), "loss: ", round(loss, 2), " alpha: ", round(alpha, 6), "\n")
    
    # this piece of code just adds steps to an existing plot
    if (plot && !is.na(beta_keep) && !is.na(loss_keep)) {
      suppressWarnings(arrows(beta_keep, loss_keep, beta_1, loss, lty=2, col="blue"))
    }
    
    # store the last estimate for plotting
    beta_keep <- beta_1; loss_keep <- loss;
    
    # store the last estimate to check convergence
    old_beta_1 <- beta_1
    
    # update estimate
    f <- beta_1 * x
    resid <- y - f    
    beta_1 <- beta_1 + alpha * sum(resid * x)
    
    # compute difference after taking step
    # to check convergence
    difference <- (beta_1 - old_beta_1)^2 / (old_beta_1)^2
  
    # compute loss and derivative for updated estimate
    loss <- compute_loss(beta_1, x, y)

    i <- i+1
    
    # shorten the step size
    if ((i %% 3) == 0) alpha <- alpha / 2
  }
  if (plot) {
    suppressWarnings(arrows(beta_keep, loss_keep, beta_1, loss, lty=2, col="blue"))
  }
  beta_1
}
```


Let's run this algorithm and track what it does:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=15, fig.height=10, cache=FALSE}
plot(beta, sapply(beta, compute_loss, x=x, y=y), type="l", lwd=2, ylab=expression(L(beta[1])),cex.lab=1.5,xlab=expression(beta[1]), xlim=c(-20,20), main="Gradient Descent")

estimate <- gradient_descent(x, y, plot=TRUE)
```

This algorithm is referred to as "Batch" gradient descent, since we take a step (update $\beta_1$) by calculating derivative with respect to _all_ $n$ observations in our dataset. For clarity, let's write out the update equation again:

$$
\beta_1 = \beta_1 + \alpha \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i, \beta_1)) x_i
$$

where $f(x_i) = \beta_1 x_i$.

For multiple predictors (e.g., adding an intercept), this generalizes to the _gradient_ i.e., the vector of first derivatives of _loss_ with respect to parameters.

The update equation is exactly the same for least squares regression

$$
\mathbf{\beta} = \mathbf{\beta} + \alpha \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(\mathbf{x}_i, \beta)) \mathbf{x}_i
$$

where $f(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\beta}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip}$

Gradiest descent falls within a family of optimization methods called _first-order methods_ (first-order means they use derivatives only). These methods have properties amenable to use with very large datasets:

1. Inexpensive updates    
2. "Stochastic" version can converge with few sweeps of the data  
3. "Stochastic" version easily extended to streams  
4. Easily parallelizable  

Drawback: Can take many steps before converging

## Stochastic gradient descent

**Key Idea**: Update parameters using update equation _one observation at a time_:

1. Initialize $\beta=\mathbf{0}$, $i=1$
2. Repeat until convergence
  - For $i=1$ to $n$
    - Set $\beta = \beta + \alpha (y_i - f(\mathbf{x}_i, \beta)) \mathbf{x}_i$

This is a full implementation of stochastic gradient descent for our example dataset:

```{r}
# Implementation of stochastic gradient descent for least squares regression
# for a single predictor (x)
#
# There is some code here that is only used to generate illustrative plots
stochastic_gradient_descent <- function(x, y, tol=1e-6, maxit=50, plot=FALSE) {
  n <- length(y)
  
  # initialize estimate
  beta_1 <- 0; i <- 0; beta_keep <- NA
  
  # compute loss at first estimate
  loss <- compute_loss(beta_1, x, y); loss_keep <- NA
  
  # initial step size
  alpha <- 1e-3
  difference <- Inf
  
  # check for convergence
  # (in practice a max number of iterations is used)
  while ((difference > tol) && (i < maxit)) {
    cat("it: ", i, " beta: ", round(beta_1, 2), "loss: ", round(loss, 2), " alpha: ", round(alpha, 6), "\n")
    
    # store last estimate to check convergence
    old_beta_1 <- beta_1
    
    # iterate over observations
    for (j in seq(1,n)) {
      
      # add step to plot
      if (plot && !is.na(beta_keep) && !is.na(loss_keep)) {
        suppressWarnings(arrows(beta_keep, loss_keep, beta_1, loss, lty=2, col="blue"))
      }
      
      # store last estimate and loss for plotting
      beta_keep <- beta_1; loss_keep <- loss;
      
      # update estimate with j-th observation
      f <- beta_1 * x[j]
      resid <- y[j] - f      
      beta_1 <- beta_1 + alpha * resid * x[j]
      
      # compute loss with new estimate
      loss <- compute_loss(beta_1, x, y)
    }
    
    # check difference between current and old estimate
    # to check convergence
    difference <- (beta_1 - old_beta_1)^2 / old_beta_1^2
    i <- i+1
    
    # update step size
    if ((i %% 5) == 0) alpha <- alpha / 2
  }
  
  if (plot) {
    suppressWarnings(arrows(beta_keep, loss_keep, beta_1, loss, lty=2, col="blue"))
  }
  
  beta_1
}
```


Let's run this and see what it does:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=15, fig.height=10, cache=FALSE}
plot(beta, sapply(beta, compute_loss, x=x, y=y), type="l", lwd=2, ylab=expression(L(beta[1])),cex.lab=1.5,xlab=expression(beta[1]), xlim=c(-20,20), main="Stochastic Gradient Descent")
estimate <- stochastic_gradient_descent(x, y, plot=TRUE)
```

The stochastic gradient descent algorithm can easily adapt to _data streams_ where we receive observations one at a time and _assume_ they are not stored. This setting falls in the general category of _online_ learning.

## Parallelizing gradient descent

Gradient descent algorithms are easily parallelizable:

- Split observations across computing units  
- For each step, compute partial sum for each partition (map), compute final update (reduce)  

$$
\beta = \beta + \alpha * \sum_{\mathrm{partition}\; p} \sum_{i \in p} (y_i - f(\mathbf{x_i}, \beta)) \mathbf{x}_i
$$

This observation has resulted in their implementation if systems for large-scale learning:

1. [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki)
  - Implements general framework of (sparse) stochastic gradient descent for many optimization problems
  - R interface: [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RVowpalWabbit/index.html]
  
2. [Spark MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.1/mllib-guide.html)
  - Implements many learning algorithms using Spark framework we saw previously
  - Some access to the MLlib API via R, but built on primitives accessible through `SparkR` library we saw previously
