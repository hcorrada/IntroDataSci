# Why Stats?

In this class we learn _Statistical and Machine Learning_ techniques for data analysis.

By the time we are done, you should 

- be able to read **critically** papers or reports that use these methods.
- be able to use these methods for daata analysis

---

# Why Stats?

In either case, you will need to ask yourself if findings are **statistically significant**.

class: split-50

# Why Stats?

.column[
- Use a classification algorithm to distinguish images
- Accurate 70 out of 100 cases.
- Could this happen by chance alone?

# Why Stats?

To be able to answer these question, we need to understand some basic probabilistic and statistical principles. 

In this course unit we will review some of these principles.

# Variation, randomness and stochasticity

class: split-30

So far, we have not spoken about _randomness_ and _stochasticity_. 
We have, however, spoken about _variation_. 

.column[_spread_ in a dataset refers to the fact that in a population of entities
there is naturally occuring variation in measurements]

Another example: in sets of tweets there is natural variation in the frequency of word usage.

In summary, we can discuss the notion of _variation_ without referring to any randomness, stochasticity or noise.

# Why Probability?

---


Because, we **do** want to distinguish, when possible:

  - natural occuring variation, vs.
  - randomness or stochasticity

---

Example: want to learn something about education loan debt for 19-30 year olds in Maryland. 

- Find loan debt for **all** 19-30 year old Maryland residents, and calculate mean and standard deviation. 

--

- That's difficult to do for all residents. 

--

- Instead we sample (say by randomly sending Twitter surveys), and _estimate_ the average and standard deviation of debt in this population from the sample. 

---

Now, this presents an issue since we could do the same from a different random sample and get a different set of estimates. Why? 

--

Because there is naturally-occuring variation in this population.  

---

So, a simple question to ask is: 

&gt; How good are our _estimates_ of debt mean and standard deviation from sample of 19-30 year old Marylanders? 

---

Another example: suppose we build a predictive model of loan debt for 19-30 year old Marylanders based on other variables (e.g., sex, income, education, wages, etc.) from our sample. 

--

&gt; How good will this model perform when predicting debt in general?

---

We use probability and statistics to answer these questions. 

--

- Probability captures stochasticity in the sampling process, while

--

- we _model_ naturally occuring variation in measurements in a population of interest.

# One final word

The term _population_ means 

&gt; **the entire** collection of entities we want to model 

This could include people, but also images, text, chess positions, etc.
