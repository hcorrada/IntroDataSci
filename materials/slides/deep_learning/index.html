## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

In this unit we study neural networks and recent advances in Deep Learning.

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

To motivate our discussion of Deep Neural Networks, let's turn to simple but very powerful class of models. 

As per the usual regression setting, suppose 

- given predictors (attributes) `\(\{X_1, \ldots, X_p\}\)` for an observation 

- we want to predict a continuous outcome `\(Y\)`. 

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

The Projection-Pursuit Regression (PPR) model predicts outcome `\(Y\)` using function `\(f(X)\)` as 

$$
f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^M g_m(\mathbf{w}_m'X)
$$

where:

- `\(\mathbf{w}_m\)` is a p-dimensional _weight vector_
- so, `\(\mathbf{w}'X=\sum_{j=1}^p w_{mj} x_j\)` is a linear combination of predictors `\(x_j\)`
- and `\(g_m\)`, `\(m=1,\ldots,M\)` are univariate non-linear functions (a smoothing spline for example)

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

Our prediction function is a linear function (with `\(M\)` terms). 

Each term `\(g_m(\mathbf{w}_m'X)\)` is the result of applying a non-linear function to, what we can think of as, a _derived feature_ (or derived predictor) `\(V_m = \mathbf{w}_m'X\)`.

---
exclude: false

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

Here's another intuition. Recall the Principal Component Analysis problem we saw in the previous unit. 

Given: 
 - Data set `\(\{\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n\}\)`, where `\(\mathbf{x}_i\)` is the vector
of `\(p\)` variable values for the `\(i\)`-th observation. 

Return: 
  - Matrix `\(\left[ \phi_1, \phi_2, \ldots, \phi_p \right]\)` of _linear transformations_ that retain _maximal variance_.

---
exclude: false

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

Matrix `\(\left[ \phi_1, \phi_2, \ldots, \phi_p \right]\)` of _linear transformations_

You can think of the first vector `\(\phi_1\)` as a linear transformation that embeds observations into 1 dimension:

`$$Z_1 = \phi_{11}X_1 + \phi_{21} X_2 + \cdots + \phi_{p1} X_p$$`

where `\(\phi_1\)` is selected so that the resulting dataset `\(\{ z_1, \ldots, z_n\}\)` has _maximum variance_.

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

$$
f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^M g_m(\mathbf{w}_m'X)
$$

In PPR we are reducing the dimensionality of `\(X\)` from `\(p\)` to `\(M\)` using linear projections, 

And building a regression function over the representation with reduced dimension. 

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

Let's revist the data from our previous unit and see how the PPR model performs. 

This is a time series dataset of mortgage affordability
as calculated and distributed by Zillow: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/. 







The dataset contains affordability measurements for 76 counties with data from 1979 to 2017. Here we plot the time series of affordability for all counties.

## Projection-Pursuit Regression


&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/ppr_plot_df-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

So, how can we fit the PPR model? 

As we have done previously in other regression settings, we start with a loss function to minimize

`$$L(g,W) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ y_i - \sum_{m=1}^M g_m(\mathbf{w}_m'x_i) \right]^2$$`

Use an optimization method to minimize the error of the model. 

For simplicity let's consider a model with `\(M=1\)` and drop the subscript `\(m\)`. 

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

Consider the following procedure

- Initialize weight vector `\(\mathbf{w}\)` to some value `\(\mathbf{w}_{\textrm{old}}\)` 

- Construct derived variable `\(v=\mathbf{w}_{\textrm{old}}\)`

- Use a non-linear regression method to fit function `\(g\)` based on model `\(E[Y|V]=g(v)\)`. You can use additive splines or loess  

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

- Given function `\(g\)` now update weight vector `\(\mathbf{w}_{\textrm{old}}\)` using a gradient descent method

`\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{w} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{w}_{old} + 2 \alpha \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i-g(v_i))g'(v_i) x_i \\
{} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{w}_{old} + 2 \alpha \sum_{i=1}^N r_i x_i
\end{aligned}`

where `\(\alpha\)` is a learning rate. 

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

`\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{w} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{w}_{old} + 2 \alpha \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i-g(v_i))g'(v_i) x_i \\
{} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{w}_{old} + 2 \alpha \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{r}_i x_i
\end{aligned}`

In the second line we rewrite the gradient in terms of the residual `\(r_i\)` of the current model `\(g(v_i)\)` (using the derived feature `\(v\)`) weighted by, what we could think of, as the _sensitivity_ of the model to changes in derived feature `\(v_i\)`.

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

Given an updated weight vector `\(\mathbf{w}\)` we can then fit `\(g\)` again and continue iterating until a stop condition is reached.

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

Let's consider the PPR and this fitting technique a bit more in detail with a few observations

We can think of the PPR model as composing three functions: 

- the linear projection `\(\mathbf{w}'x\)`, 
- the result of non-linear function `\(g\)` and, in the case when `\(M&gt;1\)`, 
- the linear combination of the `\(g_m\)` functions.

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

To tie this to the formulation usually described in the neural network literature we make one slight change to our understanding of _derived feature_. 

Consider the case `\(M&gt;1\)`, the final predictor is a linear combination `\(\sum_{i=1}^M g_m(v_m)\)`. 

We could also think of each term `\(g_m(v_m)\)` as providing a _non-linear_ dimensionality reduction to a single _derived feature_. 

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

This interpretation is closer to that used in the neural network literature, at each stage of the composition we apply a non-linear transform to the data of the type `\(g(\mathbf{w}'x)\)`.

---

## Projection-Pursuit Regression

The fitting procedure propagates errors (residuals) down this function composition in a stage-wise manner.

---

## Feed-forward Neural Networks

We can now write the general formulation for a feed-forward neural network. 

We will present the formulation for a general case where we are modeling `\(K\)` outcomes `\(Y_1,\ldots,Y_k\)` as `\(f_1(X),\ldots,f_K(X)\)`. 

---

## Feed-forward Neural Networks

In multi-class classification, categorical outcome may take multiple values

We consider `\(Y_k\)` as a discriminant function for class `\(k\)`, 

Final classification is made using `\(\arg \max_k Y_k\)`. For regression, we can take `\(K=1\)`.

---

## Feed-forward Neural Networks

A single layer feed-forward neural network is defined as

`$$h_m = g_h(\mathbf{w}_{1m}'X), \; m=1,\ldots,M \\\
f_k = g_{fk}(\mathbf{w}_{2k}'\mathbf{h}),\; k=1,\ldots,K$$`

For regression, we may take `\(g_{fk}\)` to be the identify function.
]

---

## Feed-forward Neural Networks


The single-layer feed-forward neural network has the same parameterization as the PPR model, 

Activation functions `\(g_h\)` are much simpler, as opposed to, e.g., smoothing splines as used in PPR.

---

## Feed-forward Neural Networks

A classic result of the Neural Network literature is the universal function representational ability of the single-layer feed-forward neural network with ReLU activation functions (Leshno et al. 1993). 

--

However, the number of units in the hidden layer may be exponentially large to approximate arbitrary functions.

---

## Feed-forward Neural Networks

Empirically, a single-layer feed-forward neural network has similar performance to kernel-based methods like SVMs. 

This is not usually the case once more than a single-layer is used in a neural network.

---

## Fitting with back propagation

In modern neural network literature, the graphical representation of neural nets we saw above has been extended to  _computational graphs_. 

--

Especially useful to guide the design of general-use programming libraries for the specification of neural nets.

--

They have the advantage of explicitly representing all operations used in a neural network which then permits easier specification of gradient-based algorithms.

---

## Fitting with back propagation

Gradient-based methods based on stochastic gradient descent are most frequently used to fit the parameters of neural networks. 

--

These methods require that gradients are computed based on model error. 

--

The layer-wise propagation of error is at the core of these gradient computations. 

--

This is called back-propagation.

---
layout:true
class: split-50

## Fitting with back propagation

.column[
.center[
&lt;img src="images/nnet_compgraph.png" width="30%" /&gt;
]
]

---

.column[
Assume we have a current estimate of model parameters, and we are processing one observation `\(x\)` (in practice a small batch of observations is used). 
]

---

.column[
First, to perform back propation we must compute the error of the model on observation `\(x\)` given the current set of parameters. 

To do this we compute all activation functions along the computation graph from the bottom up.
]

---

.column[
Once we have computed output `\(\hat{y}\)`, we can compute error (or, generally, cost) `\(J(y,\hat{y})\)`. 

Once we do this we can walk back through the computation graph to obtain gradients of cost `\(J\)` with respect to any of the model parameters applying the chain rule. 
]

---


.column[
We will continously update a gradient vector `\(\nabla\)`. 

First, we set `\(\nabla \leftarrow \nabla_{\hat{y}}J\)`
]

---


.column[Next, we need the gradient `\(\nabla_t J\)`

We apply the chain rule to obtain `\(\nabla_t J=\nabla \odot f'(t)\)` 

- `\(f'\)` is the derivative of the softmax function
- `\(\odot\)` is element-wise multiplication. 

Set `\(\nabla \leftarrow \nabla_t J\)`.
]

---


.column[
Next, we want to compute `\(\nabla_{W_k} J\)`. 

We can do so using the gradient we just computed `\(\nabla\)` since `\(\nabla_{W_k} J =\nabla_t J \nabla_{W_k} t\)`. 

In this case, we get `\(\nabla_{W_k} J = \nabla \mathbf{h}'\)`.
]

---


.column[
At this point we have computed gradients for the weight matrix `\(W_k\)` from the hidden layer to the output layer, which we can use to update those parameters as part of stochastic gradient descent.
]

---

.column[
Once we have computed gradients for weights connecting the hidden and output layers, we can compute gradients for weights connecting the input and hidden layers. 
]

---

.column[
We require `\(\nabla_{\mathbf{h}} J\)`, we we can compute as `\(W'_k\nabla\)` since `\(\nabla\)` currently has value `\(\nabla_t J\)`. 

At this point we can set `\(\nabla \leftarrow \nabla_{\mathbf{h}} J\)`.
]

---

.column[
Finally, we set `\(\nabla \leftarrow \nabla_{\mathbf{z}} J = \nabla \cdot g'(z)\)` where
`\(g'\)` is the derivative of the ReLU activation function. 

This gives us `\(\nabla_{W_h}J=\nabla \mathbf{x}'\)`.
]

---

.column[
At this point we have propagated the gradient of cost function `\(J\)` to all parameters of the model

We can thus update the model for the next step of stochastic gradient descent.
]

---
layout: false

## Practical Issues

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based on  back-propagation algorithm as shown above introduces some complications.

---

## Scaling

The scale of inputs `\(x\)` effectively determines the scale of weight matrices `\(W\)`

Scale can have a large effect on how well SGD behaves. 

In practice, all inputs are usually standardized to have zero mean and unit variance before application of SGD. 

---

## Initialization

With properly scaled inputs, initialization of weights can be done in a somewhat reasonable manner

Randomly choose initial weights  in `\([-.7,.7]\)`.

---

## Overfitting

As with other highly-flexible models we have seen previously, feed-forward neural nets are prone to overfit data. 

--

We can incorporate penalty terms to control model complexity to some degree.

---
exclude: true

## Overfitting

The most commonly used method for this is to apply a ridge penalty term in the cost function

`$$J(\hat{y},y)=L(\hat{y},y)+\lambda \|W\|^2$$` 

where `\(L\)` is an application appropriate loss-function. 

--
exclude: true

Our discussion of back-propagation above would incorporate the gradient of this penalty term as appropriate. 

---

## Architecture Design

A significant issue in the application of feed-forward neural networks is that we need to choose the number of units in the hidden layer. 

--

We saw above that a wide enough hidden layer is capable of perfectly fitting data. 

--

We will also see later that in many cases making the neural network deeper instead of wider performs better. 

--

In this case, models may have significantly fewer parameters, but tend to be much harder to fit.

---

## Architecture Design


Ideal network architectures are task dependent 

Require much experimentation 

Judicious use of cross-validation methods to measure expected prediction error to guide architecture choice.

---
layout: true

## Multiple Minima

---

As opposed to other learning methods we have seen so far, the feed-forward neural network yields a non-convex optimization problem. 

--

This will lead to the problem of multiple local minima in which methods like SGD can suffer. 

--

We will see later in detail a  variety of approaches used to address this problem. 

--

Here, we present a few rule of thumbs to follow. 

---

The local minima a method like SGD may yield depend on the initial parameter values chosen. 

--

One idea is to train multiple models using different initial values and make predictions using the model that gives best expected prediction error. 

--

A related idea is to average the predictions of this multiple models. 

--

Finally, we can use _bagging_ as described in a previous session to create an ensemble of neural networks to circumvent the local minima problem.

---
layout: false

## Summary

- Neural networks are representationally powerful prediction models.

- They can be difficult to optimize properly due to the non-convexity of the resulting optimization problem.

- Deciding on network architecture is a significant challenge. We'll see later that recent proposals use deep, but thinner networks effectively. Even in this case, choice of model depth is difficult.

- There is tremendous excitment over recent excellent performance of deep neural networks in many applications.

However, each layer introduces more linearity into the network.

Since we train based on a loss-function, these derived representations should make modeling the outcome of interest progressively easier.

## Regularization of Deep NNs

---
exclude: true

Regularization by penalizing parameter norm is frequently used in these cases.

The obective function to minimize in this case is

`$$J(\theta; X, y) = L(\theta; X, y) + \lambda \Omega(\theta)$$`

--
exclude: true

- `\(\theta\)` includes all parameters of the network

- `\(L\)` is a task appropriate loss function (e.g. least squares for regression)

- `\(\Omega\)` is a penalty function on the parameters

---
exclude: true

Commonly used functions are

- L2 normalization, `\(\Omega(\theta) = \sum w_{kl}^2\)` for all weight parameters `\(w_{kl}\)`

- L1 normalization, `\(\Omega(\theta) = \sum |w_{kl}|\)` for all weight parameters `\(w_{kl}\)`

In both of these cases, SGD is easily adapted.

A significant issue in training deep networks.

As deeper networks are used, multiplication of gradients causes major issues.

---

This procedure continues until all layers are trained.

Hypothesis is that training each layer on the outcome of interest moves the weights to parts of parameter space that lead to good performance.

Minimizing updates can ameliorate dependency problem.

---

This is one strategy others are popular and effective

- Train each layer as a single layer network using the hidden layer of the previous layer as inputs to the model. 

- In this case, no long term dependencies occur at all.

- Performance may suffer.

---

This is one strategy others are popular and effective

## Summary

Deep Learning is riding a big wave of popularity.

State-of-the-art results in many applications.

Best results in applications with massive amounts of data.

However, newer methods allow use in other situations.

---

## Summary

Many of recent advances stem from computational and technical approaches to modeling.

Keeping track of these advances is hard, and many of them are ad-hoc.

Not straightforward to determine a-priori how these technical advances may help in a specific application.

Require significant amount of experimentation.

---

## Summary

The interpretation of hidden units as _representations_ can lead to insight.

There is current research on interpreting these to support some notion of statistical inference.

## Conclusion

Thank you for listening.

Discussion:

- Inference vs. prediction
- Computation vs. modeling
- Forecasting
- How do you see ML methods fitting within your goals?
