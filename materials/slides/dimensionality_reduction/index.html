## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised data: characterize patterns in predictor space where observation measurements are represented.

Mathematically, characterize `\(p(X)\)` over `\(p\)`-dimensional predictor space. 

Clustering methods assume that this space `\(p(X)\)` can be partitioned into subspaces containing "similar" observations. 

---

## Unsupervised Learning: Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction: assume observations can be represented in a space with dimension much lower than `\(p\)`. 

There are two general strategies for dimensionality reduction: 

- data transformations into spaces of smaller dimension that capture global properties of a data set `\(X\)`, 

- data embeddings into lower dimensional spaces that retain local properties of a data set `\(X\)`.

We will only see the first.

---

## Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method. 

Goal: _embed data in high dimensional space (e.g., observations with a large number of variables), onto a small number of dimensions_. 

--

Most frequent use is in Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization

--

Also be helpful in regression (linear or logistic) where we can transform input variables into a smaller number of predictors for modeling. 

---

## Principal Component Analysis

Mathematically, the PCA problem is:

Given: 
 - Data set `\(\{\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n\}\)`, where `\(\mathbf{x}_i\)` is the vector
of `\(p\)` variable values for the `\(i\)`-th observation. 

Return: 
  - Matrix `\(\left[ \phi_1, \phi_2, \ldots, \phi_p \right]\)` of _linear transformations_ that retain _maximal variance_.

---

## Principal Component Analysis

Think of the first vector `\(\phi_1\)` as a linear transformation that embeds observations into 1 dimension:

`$$Z_1 = \phi_{11}X_1 + \phi_{21} X_2 + \cdots + \phi_{p1} X_p$$`

where `\(\phi_1\)` is selected so that the resulting dataset `\(\{ z_1, \ldots, z_n\}\)` has _maximum variance_. 

---

## Principal Component Analysis

In order for this to make sense mathematically: 

- data has to be centered, i.e., each `\(X_j\)` has mean equal to zero 

- transformation vector `\(\phi_1\)` has to be normalized, i.e., `\(\sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{j1}^2=1\)`. 

---

## Principal Component Analysis

Find `\(\phi_1\)` by solving optimization problem:

`$$\max_{\phi{11},\phi_{21},\ldots,\phi_{p1}} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{j1} x_{ij} \right)^2 \\
\mathrm{s.t.} \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{j1}^2 = 1$$`

---

## Principal Component Analysis

Conceptually: _maximize variance_ but _subject to normalization constraint_.

The second transformation `\(\phi_2\)` is obtained next solving a similar problem with the added constraint that `\(\phi_2\)` **is orthogonal** to `\(\phi_1\)`. 

---

## Principal Component Analysis

Taken together `\(\left[ \phi_1, \phi_2 \right]\)` define a pair of linear transformations of the data into 2 dimensional space.

`$$Z_{n\times 2} = X_{n \times p} \left[ \phi_1, \phi_2 \right]_{p \times 2}$$`

---

## Principal Component Analysis

Each of the columns of the `\(Z\)` matrix are called _Principal Components_. 

The units of the PCs are _meaningless_. 

In particular, comparing numbers _across_ PCs doesn't make mathematical sense. 

---

## Principal Component Analysis

In practice, may also use a scaling transformation on the variables `\(X_j\)` to have unit variance. 

In general, if variables `\(X_j\)` are measured in different units (e.g, miles vs. liters vs. dollars), variables should be scaled to have unit variance. 

Conversely, if they are all measured in the same units, they should be scaled.

## Principal Component Analysis

A natural question that arises: How many PCs should we consider in post-hoc analysis?

One result of PCA is a measure of the variance corresponding to each PC relative to the total variance of the dataset. 

From that calculate the _percentage of variance explained_ for the `\(m\)`-th PC:

`$$PVE_m=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n z_{im}^2}{\sum_{j=1}^p \sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij}^2}$$`

## Principal Component Analysis

A useful _rule of thumb_: 
  - If no apparent patterns in first couple of PCs, stop! 
  - Otherwise, look at other PCs using PVE as guide.

--

There are bootstrap based methods to perform a statistically guided selection of the number of PCs. 

--

However, there is no commonly agreed upon method for choosing number of PCs used in practice, and methods are somewhat ad-hoc.

---

## Solving the PCA

The Principle Component solutions `\(\phi\)` are obtained from the _singular value decomposition_ of observation matrix `\(X_{n\times p}=UDV^T\)` 

--

Matrices `\(U\)` and `\(V\)` are orthogonal matrices, `\(U^TU=I\)` and `\(V^TV=I\)` 

Called the left and right _singular vectors_ respectively. 

--

`\(D\)` is a diagonal matrix with `\(d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \ldots d_p \geq 0\)`. These are referred to as the _singular values_. 

---

## Solving the PCA

Using our previous notation `\(V\)` is the transformation matrix `\(V=\left[\phi_1,\phi_2,\cdots,\phi_p \right]\)`. 

Principal components `\(Z\)` are given by the columns of `\(UD\)`. Since `\(U\)` is orthogonal, `\(d_j^2\)` equals the variance of the `\(j\)`th PC.

---

## Solving the PCA

From this observation we also see that we can write original observations `\(x_i\)` in terms of PCs `\(z\)` and transformations `\(\phi\)`. 

Specifically 

`$$x_i = z_{i1}\phi_1 + z_{i2}\phi_2 + \cdots + z_{ip} \phi_p$$`. 

---

## Solving the PCA

We can think of the `\(\phi_j\)` vectors as a basis over which we can represent original observations `\(i\)`. 

For this reason, another useful post-hoc analysis is to plot the transformation vectors `\(\phi_1, \phi_2, \ldots\)`. 

---

Here we plot the mean time series (since we center observations `\(X\)` before performing the embedding) along with the first three `\(\phi_j\)` vectors.

---

## Multidimensional Scaling

Multidimensional scaling is a similar approach to PCA but looks at the task in a little different manner. 

Given observations `\(x_1,\ldots,x_N\)` in `\(p\)` dimensions, let `\(d_{ij}\)` be the distance between observations `\(i\)` and `\(j\)`. We may also use this algorithm given distances initially instead of `\(p\)` dimensional observations. 

--

Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) seeks to find embeddings `\(z_1, \ldots, z_N\)` of `\(k\)` dimensions for which Euclidean distance (in `\(k\)` dimensional space) is close to the input distances `\(d_{ij}\)`. 

---

## Multidimensional Scaling

In _least squares_ MDS, we can do this by minimizing 

`$$S_M(z_1,\ldots,z_N) = \sum_{i\neq j} (d_{ij}- \|z_i - z_j\|)^2$$`

A gradient descent algorithm is used to minimize this function. 

---

## Multidimensional Scaling

A related method that tends to better capture small distances is given by the _Sammon_ mapping:

`$$S_{S_m}(z_1,\ldots,z_N) = \sum_{i\neq j} \frac{(d_{ij}- \|z_i - z_j\|)^2}{d_{ij}}$$`
---

## Summary

Principal Component Analysis is a conceptually simple but powerful EDA tool. It is very useful at many stages of analyses.

PCA interpretation can be very ad-hoc, however. It is part of large set of unsupervised methods based on _matrix decompositions_, including Kernel PCA, Non-negative Matrix Factorization and others.

Embedding methods seek to capture local properties of observations. Popular recent methods are `\(t\)`-SNE and UMAP.
