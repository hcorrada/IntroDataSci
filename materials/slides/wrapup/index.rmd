Start thinking of research opportunities
  - If you plan on going to grad school, it makes a big difference in applications
  - If you don't plan on going to grad school, it gives you experience thinking about data-centric problems and applications  
  
For data science, in general, it is important to show qualifaction academically, and productively. 

Have a portfolio! Github can be very useful.

**Get busy!**

- Kaggle competitions: [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/) 
- Get involved in open source projects. If there was something you wished existed while doing class work, build it!
- Join the local DS community: [http://www.datacommunitydc.org/](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/)

**Learn new things**

- Python has a lot of useful stuff for data science [http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793)
- Tutorials on Kaggle are pretty good, their _kernels_ area is fun to look at: https://www.kaggle.com/kernels
- Hector's Data Science corner: http://www.hcbravo.org/IntroDataSci/datasci_corner/
- Many resources available online

---

**Stay informed**

- Lots of interesting articles and posts, from many different perspectives: [https://www.oreilly.com/topics/data](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/data)  

- There's even podcasts!:
  - [Data Skeptic](http://dataskeptic.com/)
  - [Data Stories](http://datastori.es/)
  - [Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/)

Remember, Data Science affords opportunities beyond the mathematical and the technical.

These are skills that can make significant impact outside the technical realm: journalism, health, civics, etc.

Think about what motivates **you** first, and then figure out how to dive in.
