1. Suppose an individual has a 25% chance of defaulting on her credit card payment. What are the odds that he will default?

2. Suppose we collect data for a group of students in a programming languages class with variables X1 = hours studied (continuous), X2 = undergrad GPA (continuous), and Y = receive an A (binary, "yes/no"). We fit a logistic regression and $Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 X1 + \beta_2 X2$ and get estimates $\hat{\beta}_0=-6, \hat{\beta}_1=0.05,\hat{\beta}_2=1$.

  Estimate the probability that a student who studies for 30h and has an undergraduate GPA of 3.5 gets an A in the class.

3. With estimated parameters from previous question, and GPA of 3.5 as before, how many hours would the student need to study to have a 50% chance of getting an A in the class?

4. Consider the following confusion matrix.

|              | Observed + | Observed - | Total |
|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Predicted +  | 80         | 20         | 100   |
| Predicted -  | 30         | 70         | 100   |
| Total        | 110        | 90         |       |

a. How many True Positives are there?
