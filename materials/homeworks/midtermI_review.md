# Midterm Structure

The midterm will consist of three sections: ~8-10 multiple choice questions, ~5-7 short questions, and 1 or 2 longer questions. 
Multiple choice will test concepts and definitions along with problems similar to written exercises in class. Short questions will
be similar to written problems done in homework, along with concept questions where longer written answers are required.
Longer questions are for problem solving (e.g., design a data pipeline or SQL queries to carry out a specific task).

**You can bring 1 double sided 8.5x11in sheet of notes to the exam.**
