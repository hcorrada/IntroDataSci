This document describes material that will be fair game in the midterm exam. Each section is divided into two levels (level 1 and 2). Mastery of level 1 material is essential to do well in the midterm, level 2 is needed to do great in the midterm.

## Preliminaries

### Level 1

- Data Analysis Cycle: acquisition -> preparation -> modeling -> communication

### Level 2

- Data Analysis Cycle: as presented in slides/Zumen & Mount

## Measurement types

### Level 1

- categorical
- ordered categorical (ordinal) 
- discrete numerical
- continuous numerical

### Level 2

- factors/levels in R
- the importance of units

## Best practices

### Level 1

- the importance of reproducibility
- tools to improve reproducibility
- data science ethics and responsible conduct of research

### Level 2

- the importance of thinking like an experimentalist

## Data Wrangling

### Level 1

- `dplyr` single table operations
- the Select-From-Where SQL query
- different join semantics
- why are database systems helpful and useful?

### Level 2

- Keys/Foreign Keys in the Entity-Relationship data model
- How an ER diagram is converted into a set of Relations (data tables)
- Database query optimization principles

## Tidy Data and Data Models

### Level 1

- Components of a Data Model
- Basics of the Entity-Relationship and Relational Data Models
- The components of an ER diagram
- The relationship between tidy data, the ER and the Relational models

### Level 2

- JSON

## Data cleaning

### Level 1

- The gather and spread data tidying operations
- Regular expression basics
- Tools to extract and clean text data

### Level 2

- The _one_term_per_row_ tidy text representation

# Midterm Structure

The midterm will consist of three sections: ~8-10 multiple choice questions, ~5-7 short questions, and 1 or 2 longer questions. 
Multiple choice will test concepts and definitions along with problems similar to written exercises in class. Short questions will
be similar to written problems done in homework, along with concept questions where longer written answers are required.
Longer questions are for problem solving (e.g., design a data pipeline or SQL queries to carry out a specific task).
