This document describes material that will be fair game in the midterm exam. Each section is divided into two levels (level 1 and 2). Mastery of level 1 material is essential to do well in the midterm, level 2 is needed to do great in the midterm.

## Preliminaries

### Level 1

- Data Analysis Cycle: acquisition -> preparation -> modeling -> communication

### Level 2

- Data Analysis Cycle: as presented in slides/Zumen & Mount

### References

- Lecture Notes Ch. 2-4

## Measurement types

### Level 1

- categorical
- ordered categorical (ordinal) 
- discrete numerical
- continuous numerical
- text, datetime

### Level 2

- factors/levels in R
- the importance of units

### References

- Lecture Notes Ch. 5
- HW 1

## Data Manipulation Operations

### Level 1

- single table operations (selecting attributes, filtering entitites)
- more single table operations (sorting, creating new variables, summarization, grouping entities _group by_)
- `dplyr` operation pipelines
- the multiple types of joins 

### References

- Lecture Notes, Ch. 6,7,13
- HW 1, 2

## Basic plotting

### Level 1

- The data/mapping/geometry definition of data visualizations

### Level 2

- Frequent used plots: scatterplot, bar graph, histogram, boxplot

### References

- Lecture Notes, Ch. 8

## Best practices

### Level 1

- the importance of reproducibility
- tools to improve reproducibility
- data science ethics and responsible conduct of research

### Level 2

- the importance of thinking like an experimentalist

### References

- Lecture Notes, Ch. 10

## Tidy Data and Data Models

### Level 1

- Components of a Data Model
- Basics of the Entity-Relationship and Relational Data Models
- The components of an ER diagram
- The relationship between tidy data, the ER and the Relational models

### Level 2

- Keys/Foreign Keys in the Entity-Relationship data model
- How an ER diagram is converted into a set of Relations (data tables)

### Rerefernces

- Lecture Notes, Ch. 11

## SQL and Database Systems

### Level 1

- the difference between declarative and procedural representation of data operations
- the Select-From-Where SQL query
- Joins in SQL

### Level 2

- SQL as a data definition language
- Views
- Database query optimization principles
- JSON

- Lecture Notes, Ch. 12, 14, Ch. 15
- HW 2

## Data scraping

### Level 1

- The hierarchical structure of HTML documents
- Basic CSS selector syntax: type, class, id, attribute

### References

- Lecture Notes 16.2

## Data cleaning

### Level 1

- Common problems in data tidying
- The gather and spread data tidying operations (data values as headers)
- Normalizing data tables (More than one entity in a table)
- Regular expression basics
- Tools to extract and clean text data

### Level 2

- The document-term model for text representation
- The _one_term_per_row_ tidy text representation

### References

# Midterm Structure

The midterm will consist of three sections: ~8-10 multiple choice questions, ~5-7 short questions, and 1 or 2 longer questions. 
Multiple choice will test concepts and definitions along with problems similar to written exercises in class. Short questions will
be similar to written problems done in homework, along with concept questions where longer written answers are required.
Longer questions are for problem solving (e.g., design a data pipeline or SQL queries to carry out a specific task).
You can bring 1 double sided 8.5x11in sheet of notes to the exam.
