Data science encapsulates the interdisciplinary activities required to create data-centric artifacts and applications that address specific scientific, socio-political, business, or other questions. Let’s look at the constiuent parts of this statement: 2.1.1 Data Measureable units of information gathered or captured from activity of people, places and things. 2.1.2 Specific Questions Seeking to understand a phenomenon, natural, social or other, can we formulate specific questions for which an answer posed in terms of patterns observed, tested and or modeled in data is appropriate. 2.1.3 Interdisciplinary Activities Formulating a question, assessing the appropriateness of the data and findings used to find an answer require understanding of the specific subject area. Deciding on the appropriateness of models and inferences made from models based on the data at hand requires understanding of statistical and computational methods. 2.1.4 Data-Centric Artifacts and Applications Answers to questions derived from data are usually shared and published in meaningful, succinct but sufficient, reproducible artifacts (papers, books, movies, comics). Going a step further, interactive applications that let others explore data, models and inferences are great. 2.2 Why Data Science? The granularity, size and accessibility data, comprising both physical, social, commercial and political spheres has exploded in the last decade or more. “I keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians” Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/technology/06stats.html?_r=0) “The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades, not only at the professional level but even at the educational level for elementary school kids, for high school kids, for college kids.” “Because now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.” Hal Varian (http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/innovation/hal_varian_on_how_the_web_challenges_managers) 2.3 Data Science in Society Because of the large amount of data produced across many spheres of human social and creative activity, many societal questions may be addressed by establishing patterns in data. In the humanities, this can range from unproblematic quesitions of how to dissect a large creative corpora, say music, literature, based on raw characteristics of those works, text, sound and image. To more problematic questions, of analysis of intent, understanding, appreciation and valuation of these creative corpora. In the social sciences, issues of fairness and transparency in the current era of big data are especially problematic. Is data collected representative of population for which inferences are drawn? Are methods employed learning latent unfair factors from ostensibly fair data? These are issues that the research community is now starting to address. In all settings, issues of ethical collection of data, application of models, and deployment of data-centric artifacts are essential to grapple with. Issues of privacy are equally important. 2.4 Course Organization This course will cover basics of how to represent, model and communicate about data and data analyses using the R data analysis environment for Data Science. The course is roughly divided into five areas: Area 0: tools and skills ○ Toolset (Rstudio/tidyverse/rmarkdown) ○ Best practices ○ Debugging data science Area I: types and operations ○ Data tables and data types ○ Operations on tables ○ Basic plotting ○ Tidy data / the ER model ○ Relational Operations ○ SQL ○ Advanced: other data models, db consistency and concurrency Area II: wrangling ○ Data acquisition (load and scrape) ○ EDA Vis / grammar of graphics ○ Data cleaning (text, dates) ○ EDA: Summary statistics ○ Data analysis with optimization (derivatives) ○ Data transformations ○ Missing data Area III: modeling ○ Univariate probability and statistics ○ Hypothesis testing ○ Multivariate probablity and statistics (joint and conditional probability, Bayes thm) ○ Data Analysis with geometry (vectors, inner products, gradients and matrices) ○ Linear regression ○ Logistic regression ○ Gradient descent (batch and stochastic) ○ Trees and random forests ○ K-NN ○ Naïve Bayes ○ Clustering ○ PCA Area IV: essential applications ○ Text mining ○ Graphs ○ Forecasting Area V: communication ○ Designing data visualizations for communication not exploration ○ Interactive visualization ○ Writing about data, analysis, and inferences 2.5 General Workflow The data science activities we will cover are roughly organized into a general workflow that will help us navigate this material. 2.5.1 Defining the Goal What is the question/problem? Who wants to answer/solve it? What do they know/do now? How well can we expect to answer/solve it? How well do they want us to answer/solve it? 2.5.2 Data Collection and Management What data is available? Is it good enough? Is it enough? What are sensible measurements to derive from this data? Units, transformations, rates, ratios, etc. 2.5.3 Modeling What kind of problem is it? E.g., classification, clustering, regression, etc. What kind of model should I use? Do I have enough data for it? Does it really answer the question? 2.5.4 Model Evaluation Did it work? How well? Can I interpret the model? What have I learned? 2.5.5 Presentation Again, what are the measurements that tell the real story? How can I describe and visualize them effectively? 2.5.6 Deployment Where will it be hosted? Who will use it? Who will maintain it? "],
["an-illustrative-analysis.html", "3 An Illustrative Analysis 3.1 Gathering data 3.2 Manipulating the data 3.3 Visualizing the data 3.4 Modeling data 3.5 Visualizing model result 3.6 Abstracting the analysis 3.7 Making analyses accessible 3.8 Summary", " 3 An Illustrative Analysis http://fivethirtyeight.com has a clever series of articles on the types of movies different actors make in their careers: https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/hollywood-taxonomy/ I’d like to do a similar analysis. Let’s do this in order: Let’s do this analysis for Diego Luna Let’s use a clustering algorithm to determine the different types of movies they make Then, let’s write an application that performs this analysis for any actor and test it with Gael García Bernal Let’s make the application interactive so that a user can change the actor and the number of movie clusters the method learns. For now, we will go step by step through this analysis without showing how we perform this analysis using R. As the course progresses, we will learn how to carry out these steps. 3.1 Gathering data 3.1.1 Movie ratings For this analysis we need to get the movies Diego Luna was in, along with their Rotten Tomatoes ratings. For that we scrape this webpage: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/diego_luna. Once we scrape the data from the Rotten Tomatoes website and clean it up, this is part of what we have so far: RATING TITLE CREDIT BOX OFFICE YEAR 5 Flatliners Ray $16.9M 2017 85 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Captain Cassian Andor $532.2M 2016 88 Blood Father Jonah — 2016 82 The Book of Life Manolo — 2014 100 I Stay with You (Me quedo contigo) Actor — 2014 67 Elysium Julio $90.8M 2013 41 Casa de mi padre Raul $5.9M 2012 This data includes, for each of the movies Diego Luna has acted in, the rotten tomatoes rating, the movie title, Diego Luna’s role in the movie, the U.S. domestic gross and the year of release. 3.1.2 Movie budgets and revenue For the movie budgets and revenue data we scrape this webpage: http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all (Note 01.2018: after the initial version of this analysis, this website added pagination to this URL. We will be using the CSV file scraped originally in Summer 2017 for this analysis and leave the issue of dealing with pagination as an exercise.) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## release_date = col_date(format = &quot;&quot;), ## movie = col_character(), ## production_budget = col_double(), ## domestic_gross = col_double(), ## worldwide_gross = col_double() ## ) This is part of what we have for that table after loading and cleaning up: release_date movie production_budget domestic_gross worldwide_gross 2009-12-18 Avatar 425 760.50762 2783.9190 2015-12-18 Star Wars Ep.

The latter two are in millions of U.S. dollars. One thing we might want to check is if the budget and gross entries in this table are inflation adjusted or not. To do this, we can make a plot of domestic gross, which we are using for the subsequent analyses. ## Loading required package: methods ## ## Attaching package: &#39;lubridate&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## date Although we don’t know for sure, since the source of our data does not state this specifically, it looks like the domestic gross measurement is not inflation adjusted since gross increases over time. 3.2 Manipulating the data Next, we combine the datasets we obtained to get closer to the data we need to make the plot we want. We combine the two datasets using the movie title, so that the end result has the information in both tables for each movie.

We see that there is one clear outlier in Diego Luna’s movies, which probably is the one Star Wars movie he acted in. The remaining movies could potentially be grouped into two types of movies, those with higher rating and those with lower ratings. 3.4 Modeling data We can use a clustering algorithm to partition Diego Luna’s movies. We can use the data we obtained so far and see if the k-means clustering algorithm partitions these movies into three sensible groups using the movie’s rating and domestic gross. Let’s see how the movies are grouped: TITLE RATING domestic_gross cluster The Book of Life 82 50.15154 1 Milk 94 31.84130 1 Criminal 69 14.70870 1 Open Range 80 58.33125 1 Frida 76 25.88500 1 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story 85 532.17732 2 Flatliners 5 61.30815 3 Elysium 67 93.05012 3 Contraband 51 66.52800 3 The Terminal 60 77.07396 3 3.5 Visualizing model result Let’s remake the same plot as before, but use color to indicate each movie’s cluster assignment given by the k-means algorithm. The algorithm did make the Star Wars movie it’s own group since it’s so different that the other movies. The grouping of the remaining movies is not as clean. To make the plot and clustering more interpretable, let’s annotate the graph with some movie titles. In the k-means algorithm, each group of movies is represented by an average rating and an average domestic gross. What we can do is find the movie in each group that is closest to the average and use that movie title to annotate each group in the plot. Roughly, movies are clustered into Star Wars and low vs. high rated movies. The latter seem to have some difference in domestic gross. For example, movies like “The Terminal” have lower rating but make slightly more money than movies like “Frida”. We could use statistical modeling to see if that’s the case, but will skip that for now. Do note also, that the clustering algorithm we used seems to be assigning one of the movies incorrectly, which warrants further investigation. 3.6 Abstracting the analysis While not a tremendous success, we decide we want to carry on with this analysis. We would like to do this for other actors’ movies. One of the big advantages of using R is that we can write a piece of code that takes an actor’s name as input, and reproduces the steps of this analysis for that actor. We call these functions, we’ll see them and use them a lot in this course. For our analysis, this function must do the following: Scrape movie ratings from Rotten Tomatoes Clean up the scraped data Join with the budget data we downloaded previously Perform the clustering algorithm Make the final plot With this in mind, we can write functions for each of these steps, and then make one final function that puts all of these together. For instance, let’s write the scraping function. It will take an actor’s name and output the scraped data. Let’s test it with Gael García Bernal: RATING TITLE CREDIT BOX OFFICE YEAR No Score Yet Viva - A vida é uma festa Hector — 2017 97% Coco Hector $192M 2017 31% Salt and Fire Dr. Fabio Cavani — 2017 Good start. We can then write functions for each of the steps we did with Diego Luna before. Then put all of these steps into one function that calls our new functions to put all of our analysis together: We can test this with Gael García Bernal analyze_actor(&quot;Gael Garcia Bernal&quot;) 3.7 Making analyses accessible Now that we have written a function to analyze an actor’s movies, we can make these analyses easier to produce by creating an interactive application that wraps our new function. The shiny R package makes creating this type of application easy. 3.8 Summary In this analysis we saw examples of the common steps and operations in a data analysis: Data ingestion: we scraped and cleaned data from publicly accessible sites Data manipulation: we integrated data from multiple sources to prepare our analysis Data visualization: we made plots to explore patterns in our data Data modeling: we made a model to capture the grouping patterns in data automatically, using visualization to explore the results of this modeling Publishing: we abstracted our analysis into an application that allows us and others to perform this analysis over more datasets and explore the result of modeling using a variety of parameters "],
["setting-up-the-r-data-science-toolbox.html", "4 Setting up the R Data Science Toolbox 4.1 Setting up R 4.2 Setting up Rstudio 4.3 A first look at Rstudio 4.4 R packages 4.5 Finishing your setup", " 4 Setting up the R Data Science Toolbox Here we setup R, RStudio and anything else we will use in the course. 4.1 Setting up R R is a free, open source, environment for data analysis. It is available as a free binary download for Mac, Linux and Windows. For the more adventorous, it can also be compiled from source. To install R in your computer go to https://cran.r-project.org/index.html and download and install the appropriate binary file. This will install the base R system: the R programming language, a few packages for common data analyses and a development environment. 4.2 Setting up Rstudio We will actually use Rstudio to interact with R. Rstudio is a very powerful application to make data analysis with R easier to do. To install go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and download the appropriate version of Rstudio. 4.3 A first look at Rstudio Let’s take a first look at Rstudio. The first thing you will notice is that Rstudio is divided into panes. Let’s take a look first at the Console. 4.3.1 Interactive Console The most immediate way to interact with R is through the interactive console. Here we can write R instructions to perform our data analyses. We want to start using data so the first instructions we will look at deal with loading data. When you installed R, a few illustrative datasets were installed as well. Let’s take a look at the list of datasets you now have access to. Write the following command in the console This will list names and descriptions of datasets available in your R installation. Let’s try to find out more information about these datasets. In R, the first attempt to get help with something is to use the ? operation. So, to get help about the swiss dataset we can enter the following in the console This will make the documentation for the swiss dataset open in another pane. On your own: Find more information about a different dataset using the ? operator. 4.3.2 Data Viewer According to the documentation we just saw for swiss, this is a data.frame with 47 observations and 6 variables. The data.frame is the basic structure we will use to represent data throughout the course. We will see this again repeatedly, and use a couple of other names (e.g., tibble) to refer to this. Intuitively, you can think of the data.frame like a spreadsheet, with rows representing observations, and columns representing variables that describe those observations. Let’s see what the swiss data looks like using the Rstudio data viewer. The Data Viewer lets you reorder data by the values in a column. It also lets you filter rows of the data by values as well. On your own: Use the Data Viewer to explore another of the datasets you saw listed before. 4.3.3 Names, values and functions Let’s make a very short pause to talk about something you may have noticed. In the console, we’ve now written a few instructions, e.g. View(swiss). Let’s take a closer look at how these instructions are put together. expressions: first of all, we call these instructions expressions, which are just text that R can evaluate into a value. View(swiss) is an expression. values: so, what’s a value? They are numbers, strings, data frames, etc. This is the data we will be working with. The number 2 is a value. So is the string &quot;Hector&quot;. So, what value is produced when R evaluates the expression View(swiss)? Nothing, which we also treat as a value. That wasn’t very interesting, but it does have a side effect: it shows the swiss dataset in the Data viewer. How about a simpler expression: swiss, what value is produced when R evaluates the expression swiss? The data.frame containing that data. Try it out in the console. names: so if swiss isn’t a value, what is it? It is a name. We use these to refer to values. So, when we write the expression swiss, we tell R we want the value referenced by the name swiss, that is, the data itself! functions: Besides numbers, strings, data frames, etc. another important type of value is the function. Functions are a series of instructions that take some input value and produce a different value. The name View refers to the function that takes a data frame as input, and displays it in the Data viewer. Functions are called using the parentheses we saw before: View(swiss), the parentheses say that you are passing input swiss to the function View. We’ll see later how we can write our own functions. 4.3.4 Plotting Next, I want to show the Plots pane in Rstudio. Let’s make a plot using the swiss dataset: It’s not pretty, but it was very easy to produce. There’s a couple of things going on here… plot is a function, it takes two inputs, the data to put in the x and y axes, evaluates to nothing, but creates a plot of the data swiss$Education is how we refer to the Education column in the swiss data frame. On your own: Make a plot using other variables in the swiss dataset. 4.3.5 Editor So far, we’ve made some good progress: we know how to write expressions on the R console so that they are evaluated, we are starting to get a basic understanding of how these expressions are constructed, we can use the Data viewer to explore data frames, and made one plot that was displayed in the Plots pane. To finish this quick tour, I want to look at two more Rstudio panes: the file editor, and the File viewer. As you have noticed, everytime we want to evaluate an expression on the console, we have to write it in. For example, if we want to change the plot we made above to include a different variable, we have to write the whole thing again. Also, what if I forgot what expression I used to make a specific plot? Even better, what if I wanted somebody else to make the plot I just made? By far, one of the biggest advantages of using R over Excel or other similar programs, is that we can write expressions in scripts that are easy to share with others, making analyses easier to reproduce. Let’s write a script that we can use to make the same plot we just made. In the Rstudio menu select File&gt;New File&gt;R Script This will open a tab in the File editor in which we can write expressions: We can then evaluate the expressions in the file one at a time, or all at the same time. We can then save these expressions in a script. In the Rstudio menu select File&gt;Save and save as a text file. The convention is to use the .R or .r file extension, e.g., swiss_plot.r. On your own: Add expressions for additional plots to the script and save again. Run the new expressions. 4.3.6 Files viewer Rstudio includes a Files viewer that you can use to find and load files. You can find the Files near the Plots viewer 4.4 R packages Another of R’s advantages for data analysis is that it has attracted a large number of extremely useful additions provided by users worldwide. These are housed in CRAN. In this course we will make a lot of use of a set of packages bundled together into the tidyverse by Hadley Wickham and others. These packages make preparing, modeling and visualizing certain kinds data (which covers the vast majority of use cases) quite fun and pleasent. There is a webpage for the general tidyverse project: http://tidyverse.org, which includes pages for each of the packages included there. Let’s install the tidyverse into your R environment. There are two ways of installing packages. In the console, you can use the expression: In Rstudio, you can use the Packages tab: On your own: Install the following additional packages which we will use later on: rvest, stringr, nycflights13 and broom. 4.5 Finishing your setup Complete your exit ticket as instructed.
