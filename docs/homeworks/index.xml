      <description>For class we will be using R, Rstudio and git. You can download and install each using the links below. However, you can instead use Rocker, a project built on top of Docker to manage your software installation. We&amp;rsquo;ve setup a container that will provide you with a working installation of R, and the Rstudio IDE, along with a lot of packages providing analysis tools and datasets we will use throughout the semester.</description>
