## ER Diagram

_DELETE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR SUBMISSION: Make a `PNG` or `JPEG` file with your diagram and insert here:_

![](/Users/hcorrada/tmp/er.png)

## SQL

```{r setupdb, include=FALSE}
# make sure you write the path to your sqlite path here
db <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/lahman2016.sqlite")
```

_DELETE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR SUBMISSION: write SQL in each of these chunks, set `eval=TRUE` to evaluate_

1) How many franchises are listed in the database (see [`count`](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#count))?

```{sql q1, connection=db, eval=FALSE}
```

2) How many franchises are currently active?

```{sql q2, connection=db, eval=FALSE}
```

3) Which teams won more than 100 games in one season between 2000 and 2015? Order result by descending number of wins. (attribute `W` of the Teams table contains the number of wins)

```{sql q3, connection=db, eval=FALSE}
```


4) What is the franchise name of the team with the most total wins in the database?

```{sql q4, connection=db, eval=FALSE}
```

5) What is the franchise name of the team with the highest winning percentage in a season in the database? (Win percentage is `W/G`)

```{sql q5, connection=db, eval=FALSE}
```

6) What is the franchise name of the team with the highest single-year payroll between 2000 and 2015?

```{sql q6, connection=db, eval=FALSE}
```

7) (BONUS from [MDSR book](https://mdsr-book.github.io/)): Identify players (by first and last name) that have attained through their career either a) 500 or more HRs or b) 3000 or more hits (H) _and_ have not been inducted to the Hall of Fame (see `HallOfFame` table).

```{sql q7, connection=db, eval=FALSE}
```

```{r disconnectdb, include=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
```
