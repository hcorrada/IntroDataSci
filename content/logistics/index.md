Data science encapsulates the interdisciplinary activities required to
 create data-centric products and applications that address specific
 scientific, socio-political or business questions.
 It has drawn tremendous attention from both academia and industry and
 is making deep inroads in industry, government, health and journalism.

This course focuses on (i) data management systems, (i) exploratory and statistical data analysis,
(ii) data and information visualization, and (iv) the presentation
and communication of analysis results.
It will be centered around case studies and projects drawing extensively from applications.

## Evaluation 

* Projects (35%)
* In-class work (15%)
* Written homework (20%)
* Midterm exam (10%)
* Final exam (15%)
* Class participation (5%)

You can earn full credit for class participation in three ways: (1) lecture participation, asking questions and answering your peers questions, (2) piazza participation, asking and answering questions on piazza, (3) regular attendance to office hours. To earn full credit you should aim to ask or answer a question at least once every two weeks on lecture or on piazza; or attend office hours at least once a month (that can include just going to my office hours to chat about computer science, biology, science, etc.).

## Textbook and resources:

There is no required textbook, the [lecture notes](lecture-notes/) will serve as the primary material. However, we will be drawing heavily from these sources:

*  [N. Zumel and J. Mount. Practical Data Science with R. Manning Publications Co. 2014](http://www.manning.com/zumel/).   
*  [G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani. Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. Springer 2013.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). A free PDF of this book can be downloaded at their site.  
*  [EMC Education Services. Data Science & Big Analytics: Discovering, Analyzing, Visualizing and Presenting Data. Wiley, 2015](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111887613X.html)

## Expected outcomes

1) Students will be able to create specific requirements for a
data-centric application used to address a specific problem or
question  
2) Students will be able to identify and select appropriate tools:
language, libraries and data resources, to meet specific requirements
for a data-centric application  
3) Students will be able to build and disseminate a data-centric
application from a set of specific requirements using existing tools,
libraries, data resources and publishing mechanisms.  

## Tentative Course Organization

- Preliminaries:
  What is Data Science? Who is a Data Scientist? The scope of Data Science: the open data movement, science, business, government, education, sport, and more. Introduction to the R data analysis environment. Formulating data-centric answers to scientific, business and social questions. Best practices: organizing projects, managing collaborations and expectations.

- Data Management Principles:
  Data scraping, tidying, cleaning and summarization. Basics of database systems and SQL. Exploratory Data Analysis. Exploration at scale: introduction to map reduce.

- Computational and Statistical Data Analysis:
  From exploration to inference: statistical and probabilistic models. Linear modeling: regression and prediction. Introduction to Machine Learning: unsupervised methods, SVMs, tree-based methods

- Data Mining:
  Regression and prediction at scale. Mining time series and data streams.

- Communicating with data:
  Writing with and about data: communicating the result of a data analysis. Information visualization, visualizing for an audience. Putting it together: interactive data dissemination on the web (d3.js and related technologies).

## Classroom Policies

* There will be reading assignments. Students are expected to have read the material **before** class.  
* Students are expected to attend lectures. Active participation is expected. There will be graded work done in class.  
* Assignments are to be handed-in electronically or in class as instructed on their due date. Late assignments will not be accepted.  
* There will be graded work to be done in class. Students not in class that day, except for an excused absence, will not be able to complete that work outside class.  
* Students may discuss homeworks and projects in groups. However, each
  student must write and/or program solutions independently.  
* Posting project solutions in a public online location without
  express consent and permission from the instructor is a violation of
  academic integrity policy.  
* Cell phone usage is **prohibited** during lecture, laptop use will be allowed to the extent that students **demonstrably** use it to follow along an in-class analysis or demonstration.  
* Using or referencing any materials from the web without proper citation is a violation to the honor code.   
* In this course you are responsible for both the [University's Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.jpo.umd.edu/) and the [University of Maryland Guidelines for Acceptable Use of Computing Resources](http://www.nethics.umd.edu/aup/). Any evidence of unacceptable use of computer accounts or unauthorized cooperation on tests, quizzes, or projects will be submitted to the Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course, suspension, or expulsion from the University.  
* Any student eligible for and requesting reasonable academic accommodations due to a disability is requested to provide, to the instructor in office hours, a letter of accommodation from the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) within the first two weeks of the semester.  
* Any student who must miss a class due to religious holidays should also notify the instructor during the first two weeks of class.  

## Policy on excused absences

* Any student who needs to be excused for an absence from a single
lecture, recitation, or lab due to a medically necessitated absence shall:
    a) Make a reasonable attempt to inform the instructor of his/her
illness prior to the class.  
    b) Upon returning to the class, present their instructor with a
self-signed note attesting to the date of their illness.  Each note must
contain an acknowledgment by the student that the information provided
is true and correct.  Providing false information to University
officials is prohibited under Part 9(i) of the Code of Student Conduct
(V-1.00(B) University of Maryland Code of Student Conduct) and may
result in disciplinary action.  
* Self-documentation: The self-documentation may not be used for the
Major Scheduled Grading Events as defined below and it may only be
used for only 1 class meeting (or more, if you choose) during the
semester.  
* Any student who needs to be excused for a prolonged absence (2 or more consecutive class meetings), or for a Major Scheduled Grading Event, must provide written documentation of the illness from the Health Center or from an outside health care provider. This documentation must verify dates of treatment
and indicate the timeframe that the student was unable to meet academic
responsibilities. In addition, it must contain the name and phone number
of the medical service provider to be used if verification is needed. No
diagnostic information will ever be requested.

## Course evaluations

Course evaluations are important and that the department and faculty
take student feedback seriously.  Students can go to [http://www.courseevalum.umd.edu](http://www.courseevalum.umd.edu) to complete their evaluations.
